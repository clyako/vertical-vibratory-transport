CAD for gripper assembly used in video. Design was created in OnShape, and when imported into OnShape should create both a Part Studio and an Assembly. All planar parts were laser cut out of birch plywood, and all other parts (not including hardware) were 3D printed on a Prusa MK3S+ in Prusament PLA. All tolerances for press fit dowel pins, close-fit holes, or self-tapping holes were tuned based on our in-house equipment, and may have to be adjusted for each user's case.
