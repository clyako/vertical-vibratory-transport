# Mechanical

The mechanical design of the vertical vibratory transport system plays a critical role in achieving reliable and efficient motion.

## Design Features
- **Impact Surface:** Designed to maximize surface acceleration while minimizing unwanted rebound effects.
- **Compliance:** Built-in compliance elements help manage impact forces and reduce wear on mechanical components.
- **Resonant Tuning:** The mechanical assembly is tuned to operate near its resonance frequency, enhancing energy efficiency and transport speed.

## CAD Models
- Complete CAD models of the gripper mechanism and structural components are available in the `/mechanical` folder of the repository.
- Files are provided in both native CAD formats and standard interchange formats (STEP, IGES).

## Assembly Instructions
- Detailed step-by-step assembly instructions, including fastener specifications and alignment guidelines, are provided in `assembly_instructions.pdf`.
- Make sure to verify alignment and preload settings to avoid excessive mechanical losses or misalignment during operation.
