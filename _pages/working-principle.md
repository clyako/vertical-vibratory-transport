# Working Principle

The fundamental idea behind vertical vibratory transport is to leverage controlled impacts to achieve surface accelerations greater than gravity, enabling consistent sticking and slipping cycles that lift the grasped part upwards.

## Dynamics
During each vibration cycle, the surface accelerates upward until the contact force exceeds static friction, causing slip. The interplay between sticking and slipping phases is governed by both the normal force and the coefficient of friction, which change dynamically throughout the oscillation.

## Design Guidelines
Key insights from our study:
- **Impact acceleration:** The surface must achieve accelerations well above \(9.81 \, m/s^2\) to ensure reliable upward transport.
- **Damping and compliance:** Managing energy dissipation at impact points is crucial to avoid excessive rebound and ensure consistent contact.
- **Frequency tuning:** Optimal transport velocities are achieved when the excitation frequency aligns with the mechanical systemâ€™s resonance.

We validated these principles through both simulation and physical experimentation, confirming that impact-induced acceleration provides a robust and efficient method for vertical transport.
